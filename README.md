### Weather Forecasting Model ☀️🌧️

a small repository for my machine learning class, where I created a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) model to predict the weather in Stuttgart

the model was exported as [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to build a webpage around it and compared to the [OpenWeatherMap Api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

weather data from [Stadtklima Stuttgart](https://www.stadtklima-stuttgart.de/index.php?luft_messdaten_download)
